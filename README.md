## Introduction
This project integrates real-time recognition of construction site safety helmets with various front-end and back-end applications.  
These include back-end database user recording, Line Bot violation reporting, real-time website camera monitoring, and more.  
Transfer Learning is employed to rapidly enhance the model's recognition capabilities within a short period of time.
